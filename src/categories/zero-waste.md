Everything that is thrown out or recycled needs to be collected, by heavy-ass inefficient trucks belching out CO2. The trucks take waste to sorting plants, incineration plants, landfills, etc.

People try to reduce what goes in the landfill by recycling things. For years 70% of the worlds plastic was being sold to China, but now [they aren't taking it](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2019/03/13/702501726/where-will-your-plastic-trash-go-now-that-china-doesnt-want-it).

Recycling is not the whole concern either. Scotland produces [456,000 tonnes of food waste](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-48257019) a year compared to 224,000 tonnes of plastic waste. All that food waste goes into landfills. Landfills are [the third largest source of methane emissions](https://ikipedia.org/wiki/Landfill_gas) in the United States, and methane has a twenty five times stronger heat-trapping effect than CO2.

Recycling is beneficial, but focusing really hard on the "reduce" and "reuse" is incredibly important. Use these resources to reduce what you throw out, getting as close to zero as you can.

Ferries and cruises are usually diesel powered and contribute similar greenhouse gasses to flying, so avoid cruises at all costs. Hopping on a ferry which is already transporting a bunch of trucks means your impact is not as bad, and it avoids releasing the gases as high altitude which can increase the green-house effects.

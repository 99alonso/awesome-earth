Most of us eat so much meat we're going beyond nutritional recommendations. Yes, humans evolved as omnivores, but we did not evolve eating meat 3 times a day and in such large portions. We also ate a variety of things, and nowhere near as much red meat.

25% of man made greenhouse gases come from agriculture, and most of that [comes from cows and other livestock emitting methane](http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM) as part of their digestive process. The growth of the global population, as well as a rise in demand for red meat, means more people are eating more meat, and that means deforestation. Deforestation leads to fewer trees absorbing CO2 through photosynthesis, and the use of nitrogen-based fertilizers in agriculture emits Nitrous Oxide (N2O), which is another greenhouse gas.

What can we do about this? Our personal diets collectively play a big part in this. The recommended [carbon footprint](/footprint-calculators) per-person is [5 tonnes by 2030](objective--2-tons-co2eq-per-human-per-year-by-2050), and 2 tonnes by 2050. A "meat lover" diet creates [3.3 tonnes of emissions per person](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/food-carbon-footprint-diet), and a more average diet is around 2.5 tonnes... _just_ the food! Switching to "no beef" (or other red meat) gets you down to 1.9 tonnes, and vegetarian is 1.7 tonnes, and going full on vegan would be 1.5 tonnes.

Whatever you dietary preferences are, you could make some changes. It doesn't have to be entirely vegetarian or no beef ever, it could be a "birthday steak" but otherwise sticking to white meat. Maybe you're already white-meat only but eat it every day, and you could switch to meat-weekends and plat-weeks. Experts suggest we cut our meat intake by 20%, but seeing as loads of people won't bother the rest of us need to aim for higher, maybe 50-60% less meat. Together these personal changes reduce overall demand for meat, and that means farmers can switch to other crops. In Ireland many farmers are switching form beef to sustainable logging, which is a much better use of the land, and traps carbon in the wood products they create, instead of having a bunch of farty cows!

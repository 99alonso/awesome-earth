    Air pollution causes [200,000 early deaths each year in the USA](http://news.mit.edu/2013/study-air-pollution-causes-200000-early-deaths-each-year-in-the-us-0829). 
    Billionaires and scientists are [scaling up carbon trapping programs](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/feb/04/carbon-emissions-negative-emissions-technologies-capture-storage-bill-gates) 
    with big old turbines, even looking at turning that byproduct into fuel, but those 
    same scientists are begging us to live less carbon intensive lives and fund 
    offsetting programs. 
    
    They need our help, so figure out your footprint with some of these calculators, 
    reduce it over time, and offset the rest. Take a look at [Reforestation](/reforestation/)
    for more ways to offset.

    Cooking is a major source of carbon emissions all over the world, from wood fires to gas burners. It's also bloody dangerous in some parts of the world. Smoke from open cooking fires [kills more than eight times as many people](http://www.stoveteam.org/services/the-need) as malaria.

    Many major energy consuming countries still use [fossil fuels to fill the majority of their energy needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_electricity_production_from_renewable_sources). Consider switching to a low-carbon supplier or find out about the carbon emissions happening on your countries grid right now.

    We need to [reforest an area the size of the
    USA](https://theconversation.com/reforesting-an-area-the-size-of-the-us-needed-to-help-avert-climate-breakdown-say-researchers-are-they-right-119842)
    as quickly as possible. Why the urgency? Ice shelves in Greenland are
    melting so fast that [197 billion tons melted in _July 2019
    alone_](https://apnews.com/65694195c91d4b62b275bd14a6955b4c), and abnormally
    vicious [heatwaves all over Europe are becoming more
    intense](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-48756480) and more frequent. 
    
    We're rapidly reaching a point where large areas of the planet will be too
    hot to plant forests, and increase in severity and duration of hurricanes is
    [gonna rip out more trees than
    ever](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/25/health/hurricane-maria-forest-climate/index.html).
    The more we lose the worse everything gets, the more we plant the less
    fucked everything gets, so we need to go to town on planting trees right
    now.

    Cars and trucks account for [nearly one-fifth of all US emissions](https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/car-emissions-and-global-warming). Despite the UK having [more electric charging points than petrol stations](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/now-more-electric-vehicle-charging-18934596.amp?__twitter_impression=true), roughly half of drivers [say they need more charging points](https://www.statista.com/chart/17933/what-is-stopping-uk-drivers-from-buying-an-electric-car/), meaning only [6% of new cars being electric](https://www.statista.com/topics/2298/the-uk-electric-vehicle-industry/). Hoping that everyone will maybe someday switch to electric cars is not any sort of solution for the worlds problems, but lowering or [removing our reliance on personal cars](https://www.wired.com/story/germany-proves-cars-must-die/) can make a big difference.
